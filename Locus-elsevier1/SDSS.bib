abstract = {We present a simulation of the spatial, luminosity and spectral distributions of four types of stellar objects. We simulate (1) Galactic stars, based on a Galactic structure model, a stellar population synthesis model, stellar isochrones, and stellar spectral libraries; (2) white dwarfs, based on model atmospheres, the observed luminosity function, mass distribution, and Galactic distribution of white dwarfs; (3) quasars, based on their observed luminosity function and its evolution, and models of emission and absorption spectra of quasars; and (4) compact emission-line galaxies, based on the observed distribution of their spectral properties and sizes. The results are presented in the color system of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with realistic photometric error and Galactic extinction. The simulated colors of stars and quasars are compared with observations in the SDSS system and show good agreement. The stellar simulation can be used as a tool to analyze star counts and constrain models of Galactic structure, as well as to identify stars with unusual colors. The simulation can also be used to establish the quasar target selection algorithm for the SDSS.},

@article{Smith2008,
abstract = {We discuss the advantages and limitations of ElectronMultiplying CCD technology in high precision photometry on short timescales, with special emphasis on probing the smallest structures in active galactic jets. Factors external to the EMCCD, rather than the architecture of the EMCCD itself,most often limit the pre- cision of photometry that can be reached with groundbased observations. Although EMCCDs can be used in photon-countingmode, reliable photometry can still only be achieved when careful observing procedures are employed. Observations of a small sample of blazars taken with an EMCCD are briefly discussed. An innovative two-colour photometer, based on simultaneous observations with two EMCCDs is described and the science drivers are discussed. Novel opportunities for the use of EMCCDs in lucky photometry are outlined and it is clear that certain scientific ques- tions cannot be addressed with groundbased observations taken with conventional CCDs.},

abstract = {Twenty years have passed since first light for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Here, we release data taken by the fourth phase of SDSS (SDSS-IV) across its first three years of operation (July 2014-July 2017). This is the third data release for SDSS-IV, and the fifteenth from SDSS (Data Release Fifteen; DR15). New data come from MaNGA - we release 4824 datacubes, as well as the first stellar spectra in the MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar), the first set of survey-supported analysis products (e.g. stellar and gas kinematics, emission line, and other maps) from the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP), and a new data visualisation and access tool we call "Marvin". The next data release, DR16, will include new data from both APOGEE-2 and eBOSS; those surveys release no new data here, but we document updates and corrections to their data processing pipelines. The release is cumulative; it also includes the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since first light. In this paper we describe the location and format of the data and tools and cite technical references describing how it was obtained and processed. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has also been updated, providing links to data downloads, tutorials and examples of data use. While SDSS-IV will continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V (2020-2025), we end this paper by describing plans to ensure the sustainability of the SDSS data archive for many years beyond the collection of data.},

@article{Bentejac2020,
abstract = {The family of gradient boosting algorithms has been recently extended with several interesting proposals (i.e. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost) that focus on both speed and accuracy. XGBoost is a scalable ensemble technique that has demonstrated to be a reliable and efficient machine learning challenge solver. LightGBM is an accurate model focused on providing extremely fast training performance using selective sampling of high gradient instances. CatBoost modifies the computation of gradients to avoid the prediction shift in order to improve the accuracy of the model. This work proposes a practical analysis of how these novel variants of gradient boosting work in terms of training speed, generalization performance and hyper-parameter setup. In addition, a comprehensive comparison between XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, random forests and gradient boosting has been performed using carefully tuned models as well as using their default settings. The results of this comparison indicate that CatBoost obtains the best results in generalization accuracy and AUC in the studied datasets although the differences are small. LightGBM is the fastest of all methods but not the most accurate. Finally, XGBoost places second both in accuracy and in training speed. Finally an extensive analysis of the effect of hyper-parameter tuning in XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost is carried out using two novel proposed tools.},

The area covered by the catalog is 4188 sq. deg. The quasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.47; the high-redshift sample includes 520 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 17 are at redshifts greater than five. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200A at a spectral resolution about 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in the catalog.

The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has also been updated, providing links to data downloads, tutorials and examples of data use. While SDSS-IV will continue to collect astronomical data until 2020, and will be followed by SDSS-V (2020-2025), we end this paper by describing plans to ensure the sustainability of the SDSS data archive for many years beyond the collection of data.},

abstract = {The Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) will conduct novel cosmological observations using the BOSS spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory. Observations will be simultaneous with the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS) designed for variability studies and the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) program designed for studies of X-ray sources. eBOSS will use four different tracers to measure the distance-redshift relation with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter. Using more than 250,000 new, spectroscopically confirmed luminous red galaxies at a median redshift z=0.72, we project that eBOSS will yield measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 1.2% and measurements of H(z) to 2.1% when combined with the z>0.6 sample of BOSS galaxies. With $\sim$195,000 new emission line galaxy redshifts, we expect BAO measurements of $d_A(z)$ to an accuracy of 3.1% and H(z) to 4.7% at an effective redshift of z= 0.87. A sample of more than 500,000 spectroscopically-confirmed quasars will provide the first BAO distance measurements over the redshift range 0.9<z<2.2, with expected precision of 2.8% and 4.2% on $d_A(z)$ and H(z), respectively. Finally, with 60,000 new quasars and re-observation of 60,000 quasars known from BOSS, we will obtain new Lyman-alpha forest measurements at redshifts z>2.1; these new data will enhance the precision of $d_A(z)$ and H(z) by a factor of 1.44 relative to BOSS. Furthermore, eBOSS will provide new tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales through redshift-space distortion measurements, new tests for non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field, and new constraints on the summed mass of all neutrino species. Here, we provide an overview of the cosmological goals, spectroscopic target sample, demonstration of spectral quality from early data, and projected cosmological constraints from eBOSS.},

abstract = {Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.},

abstract = {Having a need to perform differential photometry for tens of thousands stars in a several square degrees field, we developed Astrokit program. The software corrects the star brightness variations caused by variations of atmospheric transparency: to this end, the program selects for each star an individual ensemble of reference stars having similar magnitudes and positions in the frame. With ten or more reference stars in the ensemble, the differences between their spectral types and the spectral type of the object studied become unimportant. Astrokit searches for variable stars using Robust Median Statistics criterion, which allows candidate variables to be selected more efficiently than by analyzing the standard deviation of star magnitudes. The software allows very precise automatic analysis of long inhomogeneous sets of photometric observations of a large number of objects to be performed, making it possible to find "hot Jupiter" type exoplanet transits and low-amplitude variables. We describe the algorithm of the program and the results of its application to reduce the data of the photometric sky survey in Cygnus as well as observations of the open cluster NGC 188 and the transit of the exoplanet WASP-11 b / HAT-P-10 b, performed with the MASTER-II-URAL telescope of the Kourovka Astronomical Observatory of the Ural Federal University.},

abstract = {We present the Data Release 12 Quasar catalog (DR12Q) from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. This catalog includes all SDSS-III/BOSS objects that were spectroscopically targeted as quasar candidates during the full survey and that are confirmed as quasars via visual inspection of the spectra, have luminosities M i [z = 2] < −20.5 (in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with H 0 = 70 km s −1 Mpc −1 , Ω M = 0.3, and Ω $\Lambda$ = 0.7), and either display at least one emission line with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) larger than 500 km s −1 or, if not, have interesting/complex absorption features. The catalog also includes previously known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were reobserved by BOSS. The catalog contains 297 301 quasars (272 026 are new discoveries since the beginning of SDSS-III) detected over 9376 deg 2 with robust identification and redshift measured by a combination of principal component eigenspectra. The number of quasars with z > 2.15 (184 101, of which 167 742 are new discoveries) is about an order of magnitude greater than the number of z > 2.15 quasars known prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest emission lines (C iv, C iii], Mg ii). The catalog identifies 29 580 broad absorption line quasars and lists their characteristics. For each object, the catalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag together with some information on the optical morphology and the selection criteria. When available, the catalog also provides information on the optical variability of quasars using SDSS and Palomar Transient Factory multi-epoch photometry. The catalog also contains X-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra, covering the wavelength region 3600–10 500 {\AA} at a spectral resolution in the range 1300 < R < 2500, can be retrieved from the SDSS Catalog Archive Server. We also provide a supplemental list of an additional 4841 quasars that have been identified serendipitously outside of the superset defined to derive the main quasar catalog.},

abstract = {This paper presents a catalogue of optimized pointings for differential photometry of 23 779 quasars extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Catalogue and a Score for each indicating the quality of the Field of View (FoV) associated with that pointing. Observation of millimagnitude variability on a time-scale of minutes typically requires differential observations with reference to an ensemble of reference stars. For optimal performance, these reference stars should have similar colour and magnitude to the target quasar. In addition, the greatest quantity and quality of suitable reference stars may be found by using a telescope pointing which offsets the target object from the centre of the FoV. By comparing each quasar with the stars which appear close to it on the sky in the SDSS Catalogue, an optimum pointing can be calculated, and a figure of merit, referred to as the 'Score' is calculated for that pointing. Highly flexible software has been developed to enable this process to be automated and implemented in a distributed computing paradigm, which enables the creation of catalogues of pointings given a set of input targets. Applying this technique to a sample of 40 000 targets from the fourth SDSS quasar catalogue resulted in the production of pointings and Scores for 23 779 quasars based on their magnitudes in the SDSS r-band. This catalogue is a useful resource for observers planning differential photometry studies and surveys of quasars to select those which have many suitable celestial neighbours for differential photometry.},

abstract = {Studies of the photometric variability of astronomical sources from ground-based telescopes must overcome atmospheric extinction effects. Differential photometry by reference to an ensemble of reference stars which closely match the target in terms of magnitude and colour can mitigate these effects. This Paper describes the design, implementation, and operation of a novel algorithm – The Locus Algorithm – which enables optimised differential photometry. The Algorithm is intended to identify, for a given target and observational parameters, the Field of View (FoV) which includes the target and the maximum number of reference stars similar to the target. A collection of objects from a catalogue (e.g. SDSS) is filtered to identify candidate reference stars and determine a rating for each which quantifies its similarity to the target. The algorithm works by defining a locus of points around each candidate reference star, upon which the FoV can be centred and include the reference at the edge of the FoV. The Points of Intersection (PoI) between these loci are identified and a score for each PoI is calculated. The PoI with the highest score is output as the optimum pointing. The steps of the algorithm are precisely defined in this paper. The application of The Locus Algorithm to a sample target, SDSS1237680117417115655, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is described in detail. The algorithm has been defined here and implemented in software which is available online. The algorithm has also been used to generate catalogues of pointings to optimise Quasar variability studies and to generate catalogues of optimised pointings in the search for Exoplanets via the transit method.},
